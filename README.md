# Liri-Node-App

## Description:
This is an application that runs in the terminal.  This app is designed for the back-end and uses node.js.

What this application does is that it allows you to do multiple commands that allow you to search concerts, songs on spotify, and Movie information.  This app does way more than you think but don't listen to me.  Try it out for yourself.

2.) Run this command in terminal npm install request 
    a.) npm install moment
    b.) npm install ./keys
    c.) npm install fs
    d.) npm install node-spotify-api
3.) Next you will now be able to search for your concerts, spotify, and Movies by using commands.
4.) Whatever command you choose to use make sure you type this in the terminal first.  node liri.js [Command goes here]. (you don't need the brackets).
